        - Maybe use an alarm?  Invalidate the alarm if the user does it manually

Initial survey:
    - Pass an intent extra to indiciate if the person will be on a side or not
    - Indicate if the debator's pool is full (this should be done on the topic selection
      activity)
    - Post survey, present the user with their 'score'.  If the user is going into a
      debate, tell them their side.

The end of debate survey:
    - Don't force all users to immediately compelete the final survey immediately.
      Maybe replace the chat sending area with a button for the survey?
      We want to let users review the chat log before doing the survey.
